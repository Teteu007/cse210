Description of Foundation 1 Program
In developing the YouTube video program, I've used the abstraction principle. By using the Video and Comment classes, I've simplified the code by focusing on the main features and functions.

The Video class represents a video with key details like the title, author, and length. The Comment class holds information about comments, such as the commenter's name and the comment text.

This approach makes the code easier to maintain and read by highlighting the important parts of the program.
